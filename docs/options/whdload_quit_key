Summary: WHDLoad quit key
Default:
Example: 45

Use this option to register what key WHDLoad expects to quit the slave.
When this option is set, trying to quit FS-UAE via menu, keyboard
shortcuts, or desktop environment, FS-UAE will inject this keycode
into the Amiga emulation and wait for the slave to quit.

This only works if the Amiga runs something like this after the slave
quits:

    uae-configuration SPC_QUIT 1

You can force FS-UAE to quit by pressing quit twice, rapidly.
